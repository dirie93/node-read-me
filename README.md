# node-read-me
In this project, I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## User-Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

```

## Installation 

1. Ensure that you have Node.Js installed and that you have the Inquirer package (dependency) installed also. Make sure to ```npm install``` to ensure all dependencies are installed and set up for your project.

2. In your terminal, to access the prompt of questions, you need to write: ```node index.js```

## Application

In the image below, I included a snippet of the working readMe file that was generated as a result of the user inputting data into the terminal.
